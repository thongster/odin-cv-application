# React + Vite

Project: CV Application from The Odin Project's React Course

Wow! This is my first ever time working with React.

I admittedly struggled tremendously at first to understand props, states, and the general syntax around using React. I was confident with my vanilla javascript skills, but having to implement it into React with the new specific syntax rules was quite frustrating at first!

But through this project, I've learned how useful state can be - particularly because in my vanilla JS apps, my "states" got very very messy and I can already see how those apps could be improve if React was used.

This project pushed me to think in terms of components and lifting state up. I also built my first edit workflows, learned how React controls form inputs, and finally understood why controlled components are so important. Even debugging controlled/uncontrolled warnings ended up teaching me a lot.

I spent some time styling and just making sure the resume/cv builder felt "real".

In the future I may revist this project to implement a way to export the finalized CV as a pdf - that would be incredible. 

Overall, I'm really proud of this one. It feels like the first “real” step into understanding how modern web apps are structured, and it gave me a ton of confidence moving forward into the rest of the React curriculum.
